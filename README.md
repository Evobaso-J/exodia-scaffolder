<p align="center"><em>"I have assembled all 5 special modules, all 5 pieces of the puzzle! Exodia! <strong>OBLITERATE</strong> token consumption!"</em></p>

## 🧩 Why

A single `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` grows into an unreadable pile that the agent reloads in full every turn. `/exodia` splits the same knowledge into a thin router plus five narrative modules, each backed by append-only data logs. The router loads every turn; modules and logs load only when the task touches them. Max two hops to any fact.

## 🧠 Mental model: L1 / L2 / L3

`exodia` borrows Anthropic's Agent Skills loading pattern and applies it to per-repo context:

| Tier | What it is                                   | Example                                       | Loaded |
|------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| L1   | The router. Small. Always loaded.            | `AGENTS.md`                                   | Every turn |
| L2   | A module's narrative. Mid-size. Human-edited.| `context/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`        | When the task touches that module |
| L3   | Append-only data. Grepped, not read whole.   | `decisions.jsonl`, `glossary.yaml`            | When a specific entry is needed |

**Two-hop rule**: from L1, every fact is at most two more reads away. The router points to a module; the module narrative either contains the answer (L2) or names the ledger that does (L3).

## 🃏 What it looks like

After `/exodia` runs, your repo gets one router at the root and a five-module tree underneath.

**L1 / router**

The router (`AGENTS.md`) holds the routing tables. Abbreviated:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

<!-- exodia:section:overview -->
{one-paragraph project overview from the scan}

## Context Router

<!-- exodia:section:router -->
<!-- exodia:router:start -->
Route by task type. Read the relevant L2 module, then load L3 data (`.jsonl` / `.yaml`) only when needed. **Max 2 hops.**

| Task type                       | Load                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| System shape, boundaries        | `context/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`              |
| Conventions, code review rules  | `context/design-patterns/DESIGN-PATTERNS.md`        |
| Domain vocabulary               | `context/glossary/GLOSSARY.md`                      |
| Run / build / test / deploy     | `context/operations/OPERATIONS.md`                  |
| Footguns, known pitfalls        | `context/debugging/DEBUGGING.md`                    |
<!-- exodia:router:end -->

## Self-Update Rules

<!-- exodia:section:self-update -->
| Signal during conversation                                       | Target file                            | What to write |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Codebase assumption corrected by user or by evidence             | L2 `.md` file for that area            | Update the incorrect section |
<!-- exodia:self-update:rows:start -->
| Architecture or design decision taken by the team                | `context/architecture/decisions.jsonl` | New ADR entry |
| PR review surfaces new check (prod break, near-miss)             | `context/design-patterns/reviews.jsonl`| New review entry |
| API contract changes or deprecated                               | `context/design-patterns/reviews.jsonl`| New entry tagged `migration` with `old_pattern` / `new_pattern` |
| Domain term clarified or new entity appears                      | `context/glossary/glossary.yaml`       | New or updated term |
| Variant-specific behavior confirmed                              | `context/operations/variants.yaml`     | New entry under the relevant variant |
| Reproducible behaviour worth a future debugger's time            | `context/debugging/playbooks.jsonl`    | New playbook entry |
<!-- exodia:self-update:rows:end -->
```

**L2 / narrative**

A narrative L2 (`context/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`) reads like a focused module README, not a wiki dump:

```markdown
## Overview

<!-- exodia:section:overview -->
Two-service split: `api/` (FastAPI) handles request routing and auth;
`worker/` (Celery) owns long-running ingest. Shared schema in `packages/contracts/`.

## Boundaries

<!-- exodia:section:boundaries -->
- `api/` never imports from `worker/`. Communication is queue-only.
- Database access from `api/` is read-mostly; writes go through the worker.
```

**L3 / ledger**

The L3 ledger is one append-only line per entry, conforming to the schema declared on line 1 of the file:

```jsonl
# context/architecture/decisions.jsonl
{"id":"adr_20260514_103211_a4f2","title":"Move auth to gateway","status":"active","context":"Per-service JWT validation was duplicated across 4 services.","decision":"Validate at the gateway only; downstream services trust the gateway-injected user header.","rationale":"Centralizing cut latency variance and unblocked rate limiting.","consequences_positive":"One place to rotate keys; uniform 401 behaviour.","consequences_negative":"Gateway is now a hard dependency for local dev.","supersedes":null,"date":"2026-05-14"}
```

## 📚 The 5 modules

### `architecture/` : what the system *is*
The shape of the codebase: services, boundaries, data flow, build topology. L2 prose answers "what's where and why". The ledger `decisions.jsonl` is ADR-lite: one append-only entry per architectural decision, capturing the *why* so future sessions don't relitigate it.

### `design-patterns/` : how to write code here
Conventions and review rules. The L2 `DESIGN-PATTERNS.md` holds only short guardrails (2-3 lines per topic); detailed explanations live in `design-patterns/docs/<slug>.md` and are linked from the L2. Section headings inside the L2 are model-derived from the scan, not a fixed list. The ledger `reviews.jsonl` logs lessons surfaced in code review: "this PR almost shipped X, the fix is Y".

### `glossary/` : the words you have to know
Domain terms, abbreviations, and the names this codebase uses for things that have other names elsewhere. `glossary.yaml` is the source of truth; the L2 narrative explains the high-trust ones in context.

### `operations/` : how to run / build / test / deploy
Commands, environment knobs, gotchas in the dev loop. `variants.yaml` captures behavior that differs across environments or feature flags, so the agent knows "in staging this flag is off" without you re-explaining each time.

### `debugging/` : what bites you
Known pitfalls, fragile spots, recurring bug shapes. `playbooks.jsonl` is append-only: one entry per root cause, with the smell, the diagnosis, and the fix.

## ⚡ Install

`exodia` is a single Claude Code skill. Clone it at the [latest release tag](https://github.com/Evobaso-J/exodia-context-scaffolder/releases/latest) into your personal skills dir:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.2.0 https://github.com/Evobaso-J/exodia-context-scaffolder ~/.claude/skills/exodia
```

Pinning to a tag (vs tracking `main`) guarantees a consistent `(src/, dist/)` pair: `main` can be mid-rebuild between a source change and the regenerated bundle, in which case the helpers and the protocol disagree. Bump the tag in the command above when a newer release is published.

Restart Claude Code (or open a new session). Run `/exodia` in any repo. The directory name (`exodia`) must match the skill name in `SKILL.md` frontmatter; do not rename it.

**Runtime requirement:** Node.js ≥ 24.11 (current LTS). The skill ships pre-built CLI helpers under `dist/`; no `npm install` is needed to run the skill. To hack on the helpers, see [Development](#development) below.

## 🎯 Usage

```bash
cd ~/your-repo
# Open Claude Code, then:
/exodia
```

The skill scans the repo, proposes a category set, drafts each module section by section with accept / edit / reject on every `##` heading, and emits the router. Re-running on an already-scaffolded repo automatically enters incremental mode. Full interview protocol: [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).

## 🔁 Modes: Fresh / Merge / Incremental

Preflight classifies the target repo and picks the flow:

- **Fresh**: no existing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or context tree. Full scaffold from scratch.
- **Merge**: a monolithic `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` exists. With explicit consent, exodia splits it on `##`, routes each heading into a category by keyword match, and replaces the original with a thin router. Content moves, not deleted.
- **Incremental**: any top-level dir containing `<!-- exodia:section:` markers is detected as an existing exodia tree. Diffs only touch auto-filled sections; user-edited prose is preserved.

## 📓 Self-update

Every emitted `AGENTS.md` ships with a routing table that tells future sessions where to log new knowledge (bug root causes, footguns, architecture decisions, PR review lessons, domain terms, variant behavior). Each entry gets an ID of the form `{type}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}_{4hex}`. On the current branch, a new insight on the same topic replaces the entry the same branch added earlier (checked via `git diff <default-branch>`), so one branch produces one entry per topic. Once merged, the entry is settled: only a later branch can supersede it. Agents append without asking, and the user can always revert via git.

Full signal-to-file mapping and write rules: [`rules/self-update.md`](rules/self-update.md).

## 🛠 Customizing the layout

The default layout (canonical 5 modules under `context/`) covers most repos. For richer setups, like a canonical set under `docs/project/` plus a sibling handbook category at `docs/handbook/glossary/`, drop an opt-in `exodia.config.yaml` at the repo root before the `/exodia` run. The file is sparse (encode only the diff from defaults), one-shot (consumed at first run, ignored on re-runs), and throwaway (delete once the scaffolded tree is committed). However, you can always create an `exodia.config.yaml` after the first run to reshape your current structure.

```yaml
context_dir: docs/project
categories:
  operations: { drop: true }
  releases:
    path: docs/releases
    custom: true
    description: "Release notes per published version"
    l3: [release_notes.jsonl]
```

Copy-pasteable: [`examples/exodia.config.yaml`](examples/exodia.config.yaml) (full monorepo example) or [`examples/exodia.config.minimal.yaml`](examples/exodia.config.minimal.yaml) (smallest useful override). Full schema, canonical category names, path semantics, and validation rules: [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md).

## 🧱 Core principles

Inherited from [`digital-brain-skill`](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/tree/main/examples/digital-brain-skill), adapted to per-repo agent context:

1. **Progressive disclosure**. An agent pays for every token it loads, every turn. A monolithic `AGENTS.md` forces the model to reread the whole thing even when the task only touches one corner of the codebase. Exodia tiers the context so cost matches relevance: the router loads every turn (cheap, always-on map of the repo), a module's narrative loads only when the task touches that module, and an append-only ledger is grepped for the one entry that matters instead of read whole. The payoff is a context budget that scales with task scope, not with repo size.

2. **Append-only data**. Ledgers (`decisions.jsonl`, `reviews.jsonl`, `playbooks.jsonl`, etc.) are never deleted. When an entry becomes obsolete, its `status` flips to `archived` (or, for ADRs, `superseded` with a `supersedes: <id>` pointer to the replacement) and a new entry is appended. Within a single branch, an entry on the same topic is replaced in-place so one branch produces one entry per topic; once that branch merges, the entry is settled and a later branch can only supersede it via a new appended entry. The history of how the team's understanding evolved is the artifact: you can read the ledger and see *why* the current answer is the current answer, not just *that* it is.

3. **Module separation**. The five modules (`architecture`, `design-patterns`, `glossary`, `operations`, `debugging`) are chosen so each answers a different question and they do not overlap: "what the system is", "how to write code here", "what the words mean", "how to run it", "what bites you". An architectural decision lives in `architecture/decisions.jsonl`, not smeared across a debugging playbook; a runbook gotcha lives in `operations/`, not in a glossary entry. The payoff is that an agent loading one module gets a coherent slice of context, not a grab bag, and edits in one module never silently drift the meaning of another.

4. **Platform agnostic**. The output follows the agents.md convention: a root `AGENTS.md` plus a plain-Markdown `context/` tree, no proprietary frontmatter, no tool-specific directives. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and anything else that respects the convention read the same files with no adapter. The payoff is no lock-in: switching agents (or running several side by side) does not require regenerating the context tree.

5. **Two-hop rule** (exodia-specific). From the router (L1), any fact in the tree is at most two more file reads away: read the module narrative (L2), and if the answer is not in the prose, the prose names the ledger (L3) that has it. This is a hard ceiling on lookup depth, which keeps both humans and agents from rabbit-holing through chains of cross-references. If you find yourself wanting a third hop, that is a signal to flatten: either promote the fact into the module narrative or split the module.

## 🧰 Development

The skill's three CLI helpers are written in TypeScript and bundled to `dist/` with [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/), with all runtime deps inlined. The bundled `dist/*.mjs` files are committed so end users do not need to run `npm install` to use the skill.

```bash
pnpm install      # install dev + runtime deps locally
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test         # vitest (golden-master parity against the previous Python/Bash impl)
pnpm build        # rebuild dist/ via tsdown
```

CI verifies that the committed `dist/` matches a fresh rebuild. If you edit `src/`, run `pnpm build` and commit the regenerated `dist/`. The pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) does this automatically when `src/**/*.ts` is staged.

Source layout:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/parse-config.ts` | Validates `exodia.config.yaml`; emits JSON for the layout pipeline. |
| `src/resolve-layout.ts` | Merges parsed config with the canonical-ledger registry; emits the resolved `$LAYOUT_MAP`. |
| `src/init-structure.ts` | Creates the context directory tree and copies templates into the target repo. |
| `src/schemas.ts` | Shared regexes, canonical categories, and TypeScript types. |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Golden-master JSON captured from the previous Python implementation; parity is enforced by `tests/*.test.ts`. |
